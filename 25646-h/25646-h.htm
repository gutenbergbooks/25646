</div>


<p>As this little book goes to press, Massachusetts, by
an act of its legislature, is made the fourteenth state
in this country that requires the pupils in the primary,
as well as in the higher grades of public schools, to
be taught the effects of alcoholics and other narcotics
upon the human system, in connection with other
facts of physiology and hygiene.</p>

<p>The object of all this legislation is, not that the
future citizen may know the technical names of
bones, nerves, and muscles, but that he may have a
<i><b>timely</b></i> and <i><b>forewarning</b></i> knowledge of the effects of
alcohol and other popular poisons upon the human
body, and therefore upon life and character.</p>

<p>With every reason in favor of such education,
and the law requiring it, its practical tests in the
school-room will result in failure, unless there shall
be ready for teacher and scholar, a well-arranged,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
simple, and practical book, bringing these truths
down to the capacity of the child.</p>

<p>A few years hence, when the results of this study
in our Normal Schools shall be realized in the
preparation of the teacher, we can depend upon her
adapting oral lessons from advanced works on this
theme, but now, the average primary teacher brings
to this study no experience, and limited previous
study.</p>

<p>To meet this need, this work has been prepared.
Technical terms have been avoided, and only such
facts of physiology developed as are necessary to the
treatment of the effects of alcohol, tobacco, opium,
and other truths of hygiene.</p>

<p>To the children in the Primary Schools of this
country, for whom it was prepared, this work is
dedicated.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>JOINTS AND BONES.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 53px;">
<img src="images/img009l.png" width="53" height="75" alt="L" title="L" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ITTLE girls like a jointed doll to play
with, because they can bend such a doll
in eight or ten places, make it stand or sit,
or can even play that it is walking.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img009.png" width="400" height="317" alt="Jointed dolls." title="Jointed dolls." />
<span class="caption">Jointed dolls.</span>
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>As you study your own bodies to-day, you
will find that you each have better joints
than any dolls that can be bought at a toy
shop.</p>


<h3><br />HINGE-JOINTS.</h3>

<p>Some of your joints work like the hinges
of a door, and these are called hinge-joints.</p>

<p>You can find them in your elbows, knees,
fingers, and toes.</p>

<p>How many hinge-joints can you find?</p>

<p>Think how many hinges must be used
by the boy who takes off his hat and makes
a polite bow to his teacher, when she meets
him on the street.</p>

<p>How many hinges do you use in running
up-stairs, opening the door, buttoning your
coat or your boots, playing ball or digging
in your garden?</p>

<p>You see that we use these hinges nearly
all the time. We could not do without
them.</p>


<h3><br />BALL AND SOCKET JOINTS.</h3>

<p>All our joints are not hinge-joints.</p>

<p>Your shoulder has a joint that lets your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
arm swing round and round, as well as move
up and down.</p>

<p>Your hip has another that lets your leg
move in much the same way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img011.png" width="400" height="278" alt="The hip-joint." title="The hip-joint." />
<span class="caption">The hip-joint.</span>
</div>

<p>This kind of joint is the round end or ball
of a long bone, which moves in a hole, called
a socket.</p>

<p>Your joints do not creak or get out of order,
as those of doors and gates sometimes
do. A soft, smooth fluid, much like the white
of an egg, keeps them moist and makes them
work easily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />BONES.</h3>

<p>What parts of our bodies are jointed together
so nicely? Our bones.</p>

<p>How many bones have we?</p>

<p>If you should count all your bones, you
would find that each of you has about two
hundred.</p>

<p>Some are large; and some, very small.</p>

<p>There are long-hones in your legs and
arms, and many short ones in your fingers
and toes. The backbone is called the spine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img012.png" width="400" height="87" alt="Backbone of a fish." title="Backbone of a fish." />
<span class="caption">Backbone of a fish.</span>
</div>

<p>If you look at the backbone of a fish, you
can see that it is made up-of many little
bones. Your own spine is formed in much
the same way, of twenty-four small bones.
An elastic cushion of gristle (gr&#301;s&acute;l) fits nicely
in between each little bone and the next.</p>

<p>When you bend, these cushions are pressed
together on one side and stretched on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
other. They settle back into their first shape,
as soon as you stand straight again.</p>

<p>If you ever rode in a wheelbarrow, or a
cart without springs, you know what a jolting
it gave you. These little spring cushions
keep you from being shaken even more severely
every time you move.</p>

<p>Twenty-four ribs, twelve on each side,
curve around from the spine to the front, or
breast, bone. (<i><a href="#Page_38">See page 38.</a></i>)</p>

<p>They are so covered with flesh that perhaps
you can not feel and count them; but
they are there.</p>

<p>Then you have two flat shoulder-blades,
and two collar-bones that almost meet in
front, just where your collar fastens.</p>

<p>Of what are the bones made?</p>

<p>Take two little bones, such as those from
the legs or wings of a chicken, put one of
them into the fire, when it is not very hot,
and leave it there two or three hours. Soak
the other bone in some weak muriatic
(m&#363; r&#301; &#259;t&acute;&#301;k) acid. This acid can be bought of
any druggist.</p>

<p>You will have to be careful in taking the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
bone out of the fire, for it is all ready to
break. If you strike it a quick blow, it will
crumble to dust. This dust we call lime, and
it is very much like the lime from which the
mason makes mortar.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img014.png" width="400" height="242" alt="Bone tied to a knot." title="Bone tied to a knot." />
<span class="caption">Bone tied to a knot.</span>
</div>

<p>The acid has taken the lime from the
other bone, so only the part which is not
lime is left. You will be surprised to see
how easily it will bend. You can twist it
and tie it into a knot; but it will not easily
break.</p>

<p>You have seen gristle in meat. This soft
part of the bone is gristle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Children's bones have more gristle than
those of older people; so children's bones bend
easily.</p>

<p>I know a lady who has one leg shorter
than the other. This makes her lame, and
she has to wear a boot with iron supports
three or four inches high, in order to walk
at all.</p>

<p>One day she told me how she became lame.</p>

<p>"I remember," she said, "when I was between
three and four years old, sitting one
day in my high chair at the table, and twisting
one foot under the little step of the chair.
The next morning I felt lame; but nobody
could tell what was the matter. At last, the
doctors found out that the trouble all came
from that twist. It had gone too far to be
cured. Before I had this boot, I could only
walk with a crutch."</p>


<h3><br />CARE OF THE SPINE.</h3>

<p>Because the spine is made of little bones
with cushions between them, it bends easily,
and children sometimes bend it more than
they ought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>If you lean over your book or your writing
or any other work, the elastic cushions
may get so pressed on the inner edge that
they do not easily spring back into shape.
In this way, you may grow round-shouldered
or hump-backed.</p>

<p>This bending over, also cramps the lungs,
so that they do not have all the room they
need for breathing. While you are young,
your bones are easily bent. One shoulder or
one hip gets higher than the other, if you
stand unevenly. This is more serious, because
you are growing, and you may grow crooked
before you know it.</p>

<p>Now that you know how soft your bones
are, and how easily they bend, you will
surely be careful to sit and stand erect. Do
not twist your legs, or arms, or shoulders;
for you want to grow into straight and graceful
men and women, instead of being round-shouldered,
or hump-backed, or lame, all your
lives.</p>

<p>When people are old, their bones contain
more lime, and, therefore, break more easily.</p>

<p>You should be kindly helpful to old people,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
so that they may not fall, and possibly
break their bones.</p>


<h3><br />CARE OF THE FEET.</h3>

<p>Healthy children are always out-growing
their shoes, and sometimes faster than they
wear them out. Tight shoes cause corns and
in-growing nails and other sore places on the
feet. All of these are very hard to get rid of.
No one should wear a shoe that pinches or
hurts the foot.</p>


<h3><br />OUGHT A BOY TO USE TOBACCO?</h3>

<p>Perhaps some boy will say: "Grown people
are always telling us, 'this will do for
men, but it is not good for boys.'"</p>

<p>Tobacco is not good for men; but there
is a very good reason why it is worse for
boys.</p>

<p>If you were going to build a house, would
it be wise for you to put into the stone-work
of the cellar something that would make it
less strong?</p>

<p>Something into the brick-work or the
mortar, the wood-work or the nails, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
walls or the chimneys, that would make
them weak and tottering, instead of strong
and steady?</p>

<p>It would he had enough if you should
repair your house with poor materials; but
surely it must be built in the first place
with the best you can get.</p>

<p>You will soon learn that boys and girls
are building their bodies, day after day, until
at last they reach full size.</p>

<p>Afterward, they must be repaired as fast
as they wear out.</p>

<p>It would be foolish to build any part in
a way to make it weaker than need be.</p>

<p>Wise doctors have said that the boy who
uses tobacco while he is growing, makes
every part of his body less strong than it
otherwise would be. Even his bones will
not grow so well.</p>

<p>Boys who smoke can not become such
large, fine-looking men as they would if
they did not smoke.</p>

<p>Cigarettes are small, but they are very
poisonous. Chewing tobacco is a worse and
more filthy habit even than smoking. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
frequent spitting it causes is disgusting to
others and hurts the health of the chewer.
Tobacco in any form is a great enemy to
youth. It stunts the growth, hurts the
mind, and cripples in every way the boy or
girl who uses it.</p>

<p>Not that it does all this to every youth
who smokes, but it is always true that no
boy of seven to fourteen can begin to smoke
or chew and have so fine a body and mind
when he is twenty-one years old as he would
have had if he had never used tobacco. If
you want to be strong and well men and
women, do not use tobacco in any form.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>MUSCLES.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/img021w.png" width="83" height="75" alt="W" title="W" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HAT makes the limbs move?</div>

<p>You have to take hold of the door
to move it back and forth; but you need not
take hold of your arm to move that.</p>

<p>What makes it move?</p>

<p>Sometimes a door or gate is made to shut
itself, if you leave it open.</p>

<p>This can be done by means of a wide
rubber strap, one end of which is fastened
to the frame of the door near the hinge, and
the other end to the door, out near its edge.</p>

<p>When we push open the door, the rubber
strap is stretched; but as soon as we have
passed through, the strap tightens, draws
the door back, and shuts it.</p>

<p>If you stretch out your right arm, and
clasp the upper part tightly with your left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
hand, then work the elbow joint strongly
back and forth, you can feel something under
your hand draw up, and then lengthen out
again, each time you bend the joint.</p>

<p>What you feel, is a muscle (m&#365;s&acute;sl), and it
works your joints very much as the rubber
strap works the hinge of the door.</p>

<p>One end of the muscle is fastened to the
bone just below the elbow joint; and the
other end, higher up above the joint.</p>

<p>When it tightens, or contracts, as we say,
it bends the joint. When the arm is straightened,
the muscle returns to its first shape.</p>

<p>There is another muscle on the outside
of the arm which stretches when this one
shortens, and so helps the working of the
joint.</p>

<p>Every joint has two or more muscles of
its own to work it.</p>

<p>Think how many there must be in our
fingers!</p>

<p>If we should undertake to count all the
muscles that move our whole bodies, it would
need more counting than some of you could
do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />TENDONS.</h3>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 154px;">
<img src="images/img023.png" width="154" height="400" alt="Tendons of the hand." title="Tendons of the hand." />
<span class="caption">Tendons of the hand.</span>
</div>

<p>You can see muscles on the dinner table;
for they are only lean meat.</p>


<p>They are fastened to the
bones by strong cords, called
tendons (t&#277;n&acute;d&#335;nz). These
tendons can be seen in the
leg of a chicken or turkey.
They sometimes hold the
meat so firmly that it is
hard for you to get it off.
When you next try to pick
a "drum-stick," remember
that you are eating the
strong muscles by which the
chicken or turkey moved
his legs as he walked about
the yard. The parts that
have the most work to do,
need the strongest muscles.</p>

<p>Did you ever see the
swallows flying about the
eaves of a barn?</p>

<p>Do they have very stout legs? No! They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
have very small legs and feet, because they
do not need to walk. They need to fly.</p>

<p>The muscles that move the wings are
fastened to the breast. These breast muscles
of the swallow must be large and strong.</p>


<h3><br />EXERCISE OF THE MUSCLES.</h3>

<p>People who work hard with any part of
the body make the muscles of that part very
strong.</p>

<p>The blacksmith has big, strong muscles
in his arms because he uses them so much.</p>

<p>You are using your muscles every day,
and this helps them to grow.</p>

<p>Once I saw a little girl who had been
very sick. She had to lie in bed for many
weeks. Before her sickness she had plenty
of stout muscles in her arms and legs and
was running about the house from morning
till night, carrying her big doll in her arms.</p>

<p>After her sickness, she could hardly walk
ten steps, and would rather sit and look at
her playthings than try to lift them. She
had to make new muscles as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Running, coasting, games of ball, and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
brisk play and work, help to make strong
muscles.</p>

<p>Idle habits make weak muscles. So idleness
is an enemy to the muscles.</p>

<p>There is another enemy to the muscles
about which I must tell you.</p>


<h3><br />WHAT ALCOHOL WILL DO TO THE MUSCLES.</h3>

<p>Muscles are lean meat. Fat meat could
not work your joints for you as the muscles
do. Alcohol often changes a part of the
muscles to fat, and so takes away a part of
their strength. In this way, people often
grow very fleshy from drinking beer, because
it contains alcohol, as you will soon learn.
But they can not work any better on account
of having this fat. They are not really
any stronger for it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>NERVES.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 63px;">
<img src="images/img027h.png" width="63" height="75" alt="H" title="H" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />OW do the muscles know when to move?</div>

<p>You have all seen the telegraph
wires, by which messages are sent from one
town to another, all over the country.</p>

<p>You are too young to understand how
this is done, but you each have something
inside of you, by which you are sending
messages almost every minute while you are
awake.</p>

<p>We will try to learn a little about its
wonderful way of working.</p>

<p>In your head is your brain. It is the
part of you which thinks.</p>

<p>As you would be very badly off if you
could not think, the brain is your most
precious part, and you have a strong box
made of bone to keep it in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 272px;">
<img src="images/img028.png" width="272" height="500" alt="Diagram of the nervous system." title="Diagram of the nervous system." />
<span class="caption">Diagram of the nervous system.</span>
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>We will call the brain the central telegraph
office. Little white cords, called nerves,
connect the brain with the rest of the body.</p>

<p>A large cord called the spinal cord, lies
safely in a bony case made by the spine, and
many nerves branch off from this.</p>

<p>If you put your finger on a hot stove, in
an instant a message goes on the nerve telegraph
to the brain. It tells that wise thinking
part that your finger will burn, if it
stays on the stove.</p>

<p>In another instant, the brain sends back
a message to the muscles that move that
finger, saying: "Contract quickly, bend the
joint, and take that poor finger away so
that it will not be burned."</p>

<p>You can hardly believe that there was
time for all this sending of messages; for as
soon as you felt the hot stove, you pulled
your finger away. But you really could not
have pulled it away, unless the brain had
sent word to the muscles to do it.</p>

<p>Now, you know what we mean when we
say, "As quick as thought." Surely nothing
could be quicker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>You see that the brain has a great deal
of work to do, for it has to send so many orders.</p>

<p>There are some muscles which are moving
quietly and steadily all the time, though
we take no notice of the motion.</p>

<p>You do not have to think about breathing,
and yet the muscles work all the time,
moving your chest.</p>

<p>If we had to think about it every time
we breathed, we should have no time to
think of any thing else.</p>

<p>There is one part of the brain that takes
care of such work for us. It sends the messages
about breathing, and keeps the breathing
muscles and many other muscles faithfully
at work. It does all this without our
needing to know or think about it at all.</p>

<p>Do you begin to see that your body is a
busy work-shop, where many kinds of work
are being done all day and all night?</p>

<p>Although we lie still and sleep in the
night, the breathing must go on, and so must
the work of those other organs that never
stop until we die.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />OTHER WORK OF THE NERVES.</h3>

<p>The little white nerve-threads lie smoothly
side by side, making small white cords. Each
kind of message goes on its own thread, so
that the messages need never get mixed or
confused.</p>

<p>These nerves are very delicate little messengers.
They do all the feeling for the whole
body, and by means of them we have many
pains and many pleasures.</p>

<p>If there was no nerve in your tooth it
could not ache. But if there were no nerves
in your mouth and tongue, you could not
taste your food.</p>

<p>If there were no nerves in your hands,
you might cut them and feel no pain. But
you could not feel your mother's soft, warm
hand, as she laid it on yours.</p>

<p>One of your first duties is the care of yourselves.</p>

<p>Children may say: "My father and mother
take care of me." But even while you are
young, there are some ways in which no one
can take care of you but yourselves. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
older you grow, the more this care will belong
to you, and to no one else.</p>

<p>Think of the work all the parts of the
body do for us, and how they help us to be
well and happy. Certainly the least we can
do is to take care of them and keep them in
good order.</p>


<h3><br />CARE OF THE BRAIN AND NERVES.</h3>

<p>As one part of the brain has to take care of
all the rest of the body, and keep every organ
at work, of course it can never go to sleep
itself. If it did, the heart would stop pumping,
the lungs would leave off breathing, all
other work would stop, and the body would
be dead.</p>

<p>But there is another part of the brain
which does the thinking, and this part needs
rest.</p>

<p>When you are asleep, you are not thinking,
but you are breathing and other work of
the body is going on.</p>

<p>If the thinking part of the brain does not
have good quiet sleep, it will soon wear out.
A worn-out brain is not easy to repair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>If well cared for, your brain will do the
best of work for you for seventy or eighty
years without complaining.</p>

<p>The nerves are easily tired out, and they
need much rest. They get tired if we do one
thing too long at a time; they are rested by
a change of work.</p>


<h3><br />IS ALCOHOL GOOD FOR THE NERVES AND THE BRAIN?</h3>

<p>Think of the wonderful work the brain is
all the time doing for you!</p>

<p>You ought to give it the best of food to
keep it in good working order. Any drink
that contains alcohol is not a food to make
one strong; but is a poison to hurt, and at
last to kill.</p>

<p>It injures the brain and nerves so that
they can not work well, and send their messages
properly. That is why the drunkard
does not know what he is about.</p>

<p>Newspapers often tell us about people setting
houses on fire; about men who forgot to
turn the switch, and so wrecked a railroad
train; about men who lay down on the railroad
track and were run over by the cars.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Often these stories end with: "The person
had been drinking." When the nerves are
put to sleep by alcohol, people become careless
and do not do their work faithfully; sometimes,
they can not even tell the difference
between a railroad track and a place of
safety. The brain receives no message, or the
wrong one, and the person does not know
what he is doing.</p>

<p>You may say that all men who drink
liquor do not do such terrible things.</p>

<p>That is true. A little alcohol is not so
bad as a great deal. But even a little makes
the head ache, and hurts the brain and
nerves.</p>

<p>A body kept pure and strong is of great
service to its owner. There are people who
are not drunkards, but who often drink a
little liquor. By this means, they slowly
poison their bodies.</p>

<p>When sickness comes upon them, they
are less able to bear it, and less likely to get
well again, than those who have never injured
their bodies with alcohol.</p>

<p>When a sick or wounded man is brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
into the hospital, one of the first questions
asked him by the doctor is: "Do you drink?"</p>

<p>If he answers "Yes!" the next questions
are, "What do you drink?" and "How
much?"</p>

<p>The answers he gives to these questions,
show the doctor what chance the man has
of getting well.</p>

<p>A man who never drinks liquor will get
well, where a drinking man would surely
die.</p>


<h3><br />TOBACCO AND THE NERVES.</h3>

<p>Why does any one wish to use tobacco?</p>

<p>Because many men say that it helps them,
and makes them feel better.</p>

<p>Shall I tell you how it makes them feel
better?</p>

<p>If a man is cold, the tobacco deadens
his nerves so that he does not feel the
cold and does not take pains to make himself
warmer.</p>

<p>If a man is tired, or in trouble, tobacco
will not really rest him or help him out of
his trouble.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>It only puts his nerves to sleep and helps
him think that he is not tired, and that
he does not need to overcome his troubles.</p>

<p>It puts his nerves to sleep very much as
alcohol does, and helps him to be contented
with what ought not to content him.</p>

<p>A boy who smokes or chews tobacco, is
not so good a scholar as if he did not use
the poison. He can not remember his lessons
so well.</p>

<p>Usually, too, he is not so polite, nor so
good a boy as he otherwise would be.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>WHAT IS ALCOHOL?</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 60px;">
<img src="images/img039r.png" width="60" height="75" alt="R" title="R" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />IPE grapes are full of juice.</div>

<p>This juice is mostly water, sweetened
with a sugar of its own. It is flavored
with something which makes us know, the
moment we taste it, that it is grape-juice,
and not cherry-juice or plum-juice.</p>

<p>Apples also contain water, sugar, and apple
flavor; and cherries contain water, sugar, and
cherry flavor. The same is true of other
fruits. They all, when ripe, have the water
and the sugar; and each has a flavor of its
own.</p>

<p>Ripe grapes are sometimes gathered and
put into great tubs called vats. In these the
juice is squeezed out.</p>

<p>In some countries, this squeezing is done
by bare-footed men who jump into the vats
and press the grapes with their feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The grape-juice is then drawn off from the
skins and seeds and left standing in a warm
place.</p>

<p>Bubbles soon begin to rise and cover the
top of it with froth. The juice is all in motion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img040.png" width="400" height="322" alt="Picking grapes and making wine." title="Picking grapes and making wine." />
<span class="caption">Picking grapes and making wine.</span>
</div>

<p>If the cook had wished to use this grape-juice
to make jelly, she would say: "Now, I
can not make my grape-jelly, for the grape-juice
is spoiled."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />WHAT IS THIS CHANGE IN THE GRAPE-JUICE?</h3>

<p>The sugar in the grape-juice is changing
into something else. It is turning into
alcohol and a gas<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> that moves about in little
bubbles in the liquid, and rising to the top,
goes off into the air. The alcohol is a thin
liquid which, mixed with the water, remains
in the grape-juice.</p>

<p>The sugar is gone; alcohol and the bubbles
of gas are left in its place.</p>

<p>This alcohol is a liquid poison. A little of
it will harm any one who drinks it; much
of it would kill the drinker.</p>

<p>Ripe grapes are good food; but grape-juice,
when its sugar has turned to alcohol, is not a
safe drink for any one. It is poisoned by the
alcohol.</p>


<h3><br />WINE.</h3>

<p>This changed grape-juice is called wine.
It is partly water, partly alcohol, and it still
has the grape flavor in it.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p>Wine
is also
made
from currants,
elderberries, and
other fruits, in very
much the same way as
from grapes.</p>
<div class='center'> <table class="grapes" summary="grapes">
<tr><td align='left'><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
<div class='grape1'>People sometimes make
it at home from the fruits
that grow in their own gardens,
and think there is no
alcohol in it, because they do
not put any in.</div>

<div class='grape2'>But you know that the alcohol
is made in the fruit-juice itself
by the change of the sugar into
alcohol and the gas.</div>



<div class='grape2'>It is the nature of alcohol to
make the person who takes a little of
it, in wine, or any other drink, want more
and more alcohol. When one goes on, thus
taking more and more of the drinks that
contain alcohol, he is called a drunkard.</div>

<div class='grape3'>In this way wine has made many drunkards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Alcohol hurts both the body and mind.
It changes the person who drinks it. It will
make a good and kind person cruel and bad;
and will make a bad person worse.</div>

<div class='grape3'>Every one who takes wine does not become
a drunkard, but you are not sure that
you will not, if you drink it.</div>

<p>You should not drink wine, because there
is alcohol in it.</p>
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></td>
</tr></table></div>



<h3>CIDER.</h3>

<p>Cider is made from apples. In a few hours
after the juice is pressed out of the apples,
if it is left open to the air the sugar begins
to change.</p>

<p>Like the sugar in the grape, it changes
into alcohol and bubbles of gas.</p>

<p>At first, there is but little alcohol in
cider, but a little of this poison is dangerous.</p>

<p>More alcohol is all the time forming until
in ten cups of cider there may be one cup
of alcohol. Cider often makes its drinkers
ill-tempered and cross.</p>

<p>Cider and wine will turn into vinegar if
left in a warm place long enough.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<h3>BEER.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 58px;">
<img src="images/img045a.png" width="58" height="75" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />LCOHOL is often made from grains as
well as from fruit. The grain has
starch instead of sugar.</div>

<p>If the starch in your mother's starch-box
at home should be changed into sugar, you
would think it a very strange thing.</p>

<p>Every year, in the spring-time, many
thousand pounds of starch are changed into
sugar in a hidden, quiet way, so that most
of us think nothing about it.</p>


<h3><br />STARCH AND SUGAR.</h3>

<p>All kinds of grain are full of starch.</p>

<p>If you plant them in the ground, where
they are kept moist and warm, they begin
to sprout and grow, to send little roots down
into the earth, and little stems up into the
sunshine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>These little roots and stems must be fed
with sugar; thus, in a wise way, which is too
wonderful for you to understand, as soon
as the seed begins to sprout,
its starch begins to turn into
sugar.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 191px;">
<img src="images/img046.png" width="191" height="400" alt="Roots" title="Roots" />
</div>

<p>If you should chew two
grains of wheat, one before
sprouting and one after, you
could tell by the taste that
this is true.</p>

<p>Barley is a kind of grain
from which the brewer
makes beer.</p>

<p>He must first turn
its starch into sugar, so
he begins by sprouting
his grain.</p>

<p>Of course he does not
plant it in the ground,
because it would need
to be quickly dug up again.</p>

<p>He keeps it warm and moist in a place
where he can watch it, and stop the sprouting
just in time to save the sugar, before it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
is used to feed the root and stem. This
sprouted grain is called malt.</p>

<p>The brewer soaks it in plenty of water,
because the grain has not water in itself, as
the grape has.</p>

<p>He puts in some yeast to help start the
work of changing the sugar into gas<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> and
alcohol.</p>

<p>Sometimes hops are also put in, to give
it a bitter taste.</p>

<p>The brewer watches to see the bubbles
of gas that tell, as plainly as words could,
that sugar is going and alcohol is coming.</p>

<p>When the work is finished, the barley has
been made into beer.</p>

<p>It might have been ground and made into
barley-cakes, or into pearl barley to thicken
our soups, and then it would have been good
food. Now, it is a drink containing alcohol,
and alcohol is a poison.</p>

<p>You should not drink beer, because there
is alcohol in it.</p>

<p>Two boys of the same age begin school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
together. One of them drinks wine, cider,
and beer. The other never allows these
drinks to pass his lips. These boys soon become
very different from each other, because
one is poisoning his body and mind with
alcohol, and the other is not.</p>

<p>A man wants a good, steady boy to work
for him. Which of these two do you think
he will select? A few years later, a young
man is wanted who can be trusted with the
care of an engine or a bank. It is a good
chance. Which of these young men will be
more likely to get it?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>DISTILLING.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 61px;">
<img src="images/img049d.png" width="61" height="75" alt="D" title="D" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ISTILLING (d&#301;s t&#301;l&#322;&acute;ing) may be a new word
to you, but you can easily learn its
meaning.</div>

<p>You have all seen distilling going on in
the kitchen at home, many a time. When
the water in the tea-kettle is boiling, what
comes out at the nose? Steam.</p>

<p>What is steam?</p>

<p>You can find out what it is by catching
some of it on a cold plate, or tin cover. As
soon as it touches any thing cold, it turns
into drops of water.</p>

<p>When we boil water and turn it into
steam, and then turn the steam back into
water, we have distilled the water. We say
vapor instead of steam, when we talk about
the boiling of alcohol.</p>

<p>It takes less heat to turn alcohol to vapor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
than to turn water to steam; so, if we put
over the fire some liquid that contains alcohol,
and begin to collect the vapor as it rises,
we shall get alcohol first, and then water.</p>

<p>But the alcohol will not be pure alcohol;
it will be part water, because it is so ready
to mix with water that it has to be distilled
many times to be pure.</p>

<p>But each time it is distilled, it will become
stronger, because there is a little more
alcohol and a little less water.</p>

<p>In this way, brandy, rum, whiskey, and
gin are distilled, from wine, cider, and the
liquors which have been made from corn,
rye, or barley.</p>

<p>The cider, wine, and beer had but little
alcohol in them. The brandy, rum, whiskey,
and gin are nearly one-half alcohol.</p>

<p>A glass of strong liquor which has been
made by distilling, will injure any one more,
and quicker, than a glass of cider, rum, or
beer.</p>

<p>But a cider, wine, or beer-drinker often
drinks so much more of the weaker liquor,
that he gets a great deal of alcohol. People<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
are often made drunkards by drinking cider
or beer. The more poison, the more danger.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>ALCOHOL.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 58px;">
<img src="images/img045a.png" width="58" height="75" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />LCOHOL looks like water, but it is not
at all like water.</div>

<p>Alcohol will take fire, and burn if a lighted
match is held near it; but you know that
water will not burn.</p>

<p>When alcohol burns, the color of the flame
is blue. It does not give much light: it makes
no smoke or soot; but it does give a great
deal of heat.</p>

<p>A little dead tree-toad was once put into
a bottle of alcohol. It was years ago, but
the tree-toad is there still, looking just as it
did the first day it was put in. What has
kept it so?</p>

<p>It is the alcohol. The tree-toad would
have soon decayed if it had been put into
water. So you see that alcohol keeps dead
bodies from decaying.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Pure alcohol is not often used as a drink.
People who take beer, wine, and cider get
a little alcohol with each drink. Those who
drink brandy, rum, whiskey, or gin, get more
alcohol, because those liquors are nearly one
half alcohol.</p>

<p>You may wonder that people wish to use
such poisonous drinks at all. But alcohol is
a deceiver. It often cheats the man who
takes a little, into thinking it will be good
for him to take more.</p>

<p>Sometimes the appetite which begs so
hard for the poison, is formed in childhood.
If you eat wine-jelly, or wine-sauce, you may
learn to like the taste of alcohol and thus
easily begin to drink some weak liquor.</p>

<p>The more the drinker takes, the more he
often wants, and thus he goes on from drinking
cider, wine, or beer, to drinking whiskey,
brandy, or rum. Thus drunkards are made.</p>

<p>People who are in the habit of taking
drinks which contain alcohol, often care more
for them than for any thing else, even when
they know they are being ruined by them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>TOBACCO.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 58px;">
<img src="images/img045a.png" width="58" height="75" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;FARMER who had been in the habit of
planting his fields with corn, wheat,
and potatoes, once made up his mind to plant
tobacco instead.</div>

<p>Let us see whether he did any good to the
world by the change.</p>

<p>The tobacco plants grew up as tall as a
little boy or girl, and spread out broad, green
leaves.</p>

<p>By and by he pulled the stalks, and dried
the leaves. Some of them he pressed into
cakes of tobacco; some he rolled into cigars;
and some he ground into snuff.</p>

<p>If you ask what tobacco is good for, the
best answer will be, to tell you what it will
do to a man or boy who uses it, and then let
you answer the question for yourselves.</p>

<p>Tobacco contains something called nicotine (n&#301;k&acute;o t&#301;n).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
This is a strong poison. One
drop of it is enough to kill a dog. In one
cigar there is enough, if taken pure, to kill
two men.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img056.png" width="400" height="437" alt="Mill" title="Mill" />
</div>

<p>Even to work upon
tobacco, makes people
pale and sickly. Once
I went into a snuff mill, and the man who
had the care of it showed me how the work
was done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The mill stood in a pretty place, beside a
little stream which turned the mill-wheel.
Tall trees bent over it, and a fresh breeze was
blowing through the open windows. Yet the
smell of the tobacco was so strong that I had
to go to the door many times, for a breath of
pure air.</p>

<p>I asked the man if it did not make him
sick to work there.</p>

<p>He said: "It made me very sick for the
first few weeks. Then I began to get used
to it, and now I don't mind it."</p>

<p>He was like the boys who try to learn to
smoke. It almost always makes them sick at
first; but they think it will be manly to keep
on. At last, they get used to it.</p>

<p>The sickness is really the way in which
the boy's body is trying to say to him:
"There is danger here; you are playing with
poison. Let me stop you before great harm
is done."</p>

<p>Perhaps you will say: "I have seen men
smoke cigars, even four or five in a day, and
it didn't kill them."</p>

<p>It did not kill them, because they did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
not swallow the nicotine. They only drew
in a little with the breath. But taking a
little poison in this way, day after day, can
not be safe, or really helpful to any one.</p>

<h3>OPIUM.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 58px;">
<img src="images/img045a.png" width="58" height="75" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />LCOHOL and tobacco are called narcotics
(nar k&#335;t&acute;iks). This means that they have
the power of putting the nerves to sleep.
Opium (&#333;&acute;p&#301; &#365;m) is another narcotic.</div>

<p>It is a poison made from the juice of poppies,
and is used in medicines.</p>

<p>Opium is put into soothing-syrups (s&#301;r&acute;&#365;ps),
and these are sometimes given to babies to
keep them from crying. They do this by
injuring the tender nerves and poisoning the
little body.</p>

<p>How can any one give a baby opium to
save taking patient care of it?</p>

<p>Surely the mothers would not do it, if
they knew that this soothing-syrup that appears
like a friend, coming to quiet and comfort
the baby, is really an enemy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>WHAT ARE ORGANS?</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 58px;">
<img src="images/img045a.png" width="58" height="75" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />N organ is a part of the body which has
some special work to do. The eye is the
organ of sight. The stomach (st&#365;m&acute;&#259;k) is an
organ which takes care of the food we eat.</div>


<h3><br />THE TEETH.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img061.png" width="400" height="283" alt="Different kinds of teeth." title="Different kinds of teeth." />
<span class="caption">Different kinds of teeth.</span>
</div>

<p>Your teeth do not look alike, since they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
must do different kinds of work. The front
ones cut, the back ones grind.</p>

<p>They are made of a kind of bone covered
with a hard smooth enamel (&#277;n &#259;m&acute;el). If the
enamel is broken, the teeth soon decay and
ache, for each tooth is furnished with a nerve
that very quickly feels pain.</p>


<h3><br />CARE OF THE TEETH.</h3>

<p>Cracking nuts with the teeth, or even
biting thread, is apt to break the enamel; and
when once broken, you will wish in vain to
have it mended. The dentist can fill a hole
in the tooth; but he can not cover the tooth
with new enamel.</p>

<p>Bits of food should be carefully picked
from between the teeth with a tooth-pick of
quill or wood, never with a pin or other hard
and sharp thing which might break the
enamel.</p>

<p>The teeth must also be well brushed.
Nothing but perfect cleanliness will keep
them in good order. Always brush them
before breakfast. Your breakfast will taste
all the better for it. Brush them at night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
before you go to bed, lest some food should
be decaying in your mouth during the night.</p>

<p>Take care of these cutters and grinders,
that they may not decay, and so be unable
to do their work well.</p>


<h3><br />THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN.</h3>

<p>You have learned about the twenty-four
little bones in the spine, and the ribs that
curve around from the spine to the front, or
breast-bone.</p>

<p>These bones, with the shoulder-blades
and the collar-bones, form a bony case or
box.</p>

<p>In it are some of the most useful organs
of the body.</p>

<p>This box is divided across the middle by
a strong muscle, so that we may say it is
two stories high.</p>

<p>The upper room is called the chest; the
lower one, the abdomen (&#259;b d&#333;&acute;m&#277;n).</p>

<p>In the chest, are the heart and the lungs.</p>

<p>In the abdomen, are the stomach, the
liver, and some other organs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />THE STOMACH.</h3>

<p>The stomach is a strong bag, as wonderful
a bag as could be made, you will say, when
I tell you what it can do.</p>

<p>The outside is made of muscles; the lining
prepares a juice called gastric (g&#259;s&acute;tr&#301;k) juice,
and keeps it always ready for use.</p>

<p>Now, what would you think if a man
could put into a bag, beef, and apples, and
potatoes, and bread and milk, and sugar, and
salt, tie up the bag and lay it away on a
shelf for a few hours, and then show you that
the beef had disappeared, so had the apples,
so had the potatoes, the bread and milk, sugar,
and salt, and the bag was filled only
with a thin, grayish fluid? Would you not
call it a magical bag?</p>

<p>Now, your stomach and mine are just such
magical bags.</p>

<p>We put in our breakfasts, dinners, and
suppers; and, after a few hours, they are
changed. The gastric juice has been mixed
with them. The strong muscles that form
the outside of the stomach have been squeezing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the food, rolling it about, and mixing it
together, until it has all been changed to a
thin, grayish fluid.</p>


<h3><br />HOW DOES ANYBODY KNOW THIS?</h3>

<p>A soldier was once shot in the side in such
a way that when the wound healed, it left
an opening with a piece of loose skin over it,
like a little door leading into his stomach.</p>

<p>A doctor who wished to learn about the
stomach, hired him for a servant and used
to study him every day.</p>

<p>He would push aside the little flap of skin
and put into the stomach any kind of food
that he pleased, and then watch to see what
happened to it.</p>

<p>In this way, he learned a great deal and
wrote it down, so that other people might
know, too. In other ways, also, which it
would take too long to tell you here, doctors
have learned how these magical food-bags
take care of our food.</p>


<h3><br />WHY DOES THE FOOD NEED TO BE CHANGED?</h3>

<p>Your mamma tells you sometimes at
breakfast that you must eat oat-meal and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
milk to make you grow into a big man or
woman.</p>

<p>Did you ever wonder what part of you is
made of oat-meal, or what part of milk?</p>

<p>That stout little arm does not look like
oat-meal; those rosy cheeks do not look like
milk.</p>

<p>If our food is to make stout arms and
rosy cheeks, strong bodies and busy brains,
it must first be changed into a form in
which it can get to each part and feed it.</p>

<p>When the food in the stomach is mixed
and prepared, it is ready to be sent through
the body; some is carried to the bones, some
to the muscles, some to the nerves and brain,
some to the skin, and some even to the finger
nails, the hair, and the eyes. Each part needs
to be fed in order to grow.</p>


<h3><br />WHY DO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GROWING NEED FOOD?</h3>

<p>Children need each day to make larger
and larger bones, larger muscles, and a larger
skin to cover the larger body.</p>

<p>Every day, each part is also wearing out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
a little, and needing to be mended by some
new food. People who have grown up, need
their food for this work of mending.</p>


<h3><br />CARE OF THE STOMACH.</h3>

<p>One way to take care of the stomach is
to give it only its own work to do. The
teeth must first do their work faithfully.</p>

<p>The stomach must have rest, too. I have
seen some children who want to make their
poor stomachs work all the time. They are
always eating apples, or candy, or something,
so that their stomachs have no chance to
rest. If the stomach does not rest, it will
wear out the same as a machine would.</p>

<p>The stomach can not work well, unless
it is quite warm. If a person pours ice-water
into his stomach as he eats, just as the food
is beginning to change into the gray fluid
of which you have learned, the work stops
until the stomach gets warm again.</p>


<h3><br />ALCOHOL AND THE STOMACH.</h3>

<p>You remember about the man who had
the little door to his stomach. Sometimes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the doctor put in wine, cider, brandy, or
some drink that contained alcohol, to see
what it would do. It was carried away very
quickly; but during the little time it stayed,
it did nothing but harm.</p>

<p>It injured the gastric juice, so that it
could not mix with the food.</p>

<p>If the doctor had put in more alcohol,
day after day, as one does who drinks liquor,
sores would perhaps have come on the delicate
lining of the stomach. Sometimes the
stomach is so hurt by alcohol, that the
drinker dies. If the stomach can not do its
work well, the whole body must suffer from
want of the good food it needs.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>


<h3><br />TOBACCO AND THE MOUTH.</h3>

<p>The saliva in the mouth helps to prepare
the food, before it goes into the stomach. Tobacco
makes the mouth very dry, and more
saliva has to flow out to moisten it.</p>

<p>But tobacco juice is mixed with the saliva,
and that must not be swallowed. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
must be spit out, and with it is sent the
saliva that was needed to help prepare the
food.</p>

<p>Tobacco discolors the teeth, makes bad
sores in the mouth, and often causes a disease
of the throat.</p>

<p>You can tell where some people have
been, by the neatness and comfort they leave
after them.</p>

<p>You can tell where the tobacco-user has
been, by the dirty floor, and street, and the
air made unfit to breathe, because of the
smoke and strong, bad smell of old tobacco
from his pipe and cigar and from his breath
and clothes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>WHAT DOES THE BODY NEED FOR FOOD?</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 59px;">
<img src="images/img071n.png" width="59" height="75" alt="N" title="N" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />OW that you know how the body is fed,
you must next learn what to feed it
with; and what each part needs to make it
grow and to keep it strong and well.</div>


<h3>WATER.</h3>

<p>A large part of your body is made of
water. So you need, of course, to drink
water, and to have it used in preparing
your food.</p>

<p>Water comes from the clouds, and is
stored up in cisterns or in springs in the
ground. From these pipes are laid to lead
the water to our houses.</p>

<p>Sometimes, men dig down until they reach
a spring, and so make a well from which
they can pump the water, or dip it out with
a bucket.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Water that has been standing in lead pipes,
may have some of the lead mixed with it.
Such water would be very likely to poison
you, if you drank it.</p>

<p>Impurities are almost sure to soak into a
well if it is near a drain or a stable.</p>

<p>If you drink the water from such a well,
you may be made very sick by it. It is better
to go thirsty, until you can get good
water.</p>

<p>A sufficient quantity of pure water to
drink is just as important for us, as good
food to eat.</p>

<p>We could not drink all the water that our
bodies need. We take a large part of it in our
food, in fruits and vegetables, and even in
beefsteak and bread.</p>


<h3><br />LIME.</h3>

<p>Bones need lime. You remember the bone
that was nothing but crumbling lime after
it had been in the fire.</p>

<p>Where shall we get lime for our bones?</p>

<p>We can not eat lime; but the grass and
the grains take it out of the earth. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the cows eat the grass and turn it into milk,
and in the milk we drink, we get some of the
lime to feed our bones.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img073.png" width="500" height="392" alt="Lime being prepared for our use." title="Lime being prepared for our use." />
</div>

<p>In the same way, the grain growing in
the field takes up lime and other things that
we need, but could not eat for ourselves. The
lime that thus becomes a part of the grain,
we get in our bread, oat-meal porridge, and
other foods.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />SALT.</h3>

<p>Animals need salt, as children who live
in the country know very well. They have
seen how eagerly the cows and the sheep lick
up the salt that the farmer gives them.</p>

<p>Even wild cattle and buffaloes seek out
places where there are salt springs, and go in
great herds to get the salt.</p>

<p>We, too, need some salt mixed with our
food. If we did not put it in, either when
cooking, or afterward, we should still get a
little in the food itself.</p>


<h3><br />FLESH-MAKING FOODS.</h3>

<p>Muscles are lean meat, that is flesh; so
muscles need flesh-making foods. These are
milk, and grains like wheat, corn and oats;
also, meat and eggs. Most of these foods
really come to us out of the ground. Meat
and eggs are made from the grain, grass, and
other vegetables that the cattle and hens eat.</p>


<h3><br />FAT-MAKING FOODS.</h3>

<p>We need cushions and wrappings of fat,
here and there in our bodies, to keep us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
warm and make us comfortable. So we must
have certain kinds of food that will make
fat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img075.png" width="500" height="418" alt="Esquimaux catching walrus." title="Esquimaux catching walrus." />
<span class="caption">Esquimaux catching walrus.</span>
</div>

<p>There are right places and wrong places
for fat, as well as for other things in this
world. When alcohol puts fat into the muscles,
that is fat badly made, and in the wrong
place.</p>

<p>The good fat made for the parts of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
body which need it, comes from fat-making
foods.</p>

<p>In cold weather, we need more fatty food
than we do in summer, just as in cold countries
people need such food all the time.</p>

<p>The Esquimaux, who live in the lands of
snow and ice, catch a great many walrus and
seal, and eat a great deal of fat meat. You
would not be well unless you ate some fat or
butter or oil.</p>


<h3><br />WHAT WILL MAKE FAT?</h3>

<p>Sugar will make fat, and so will starch,
cream, rice, butter, and fat meat. As milk
will make muscle and fat and bones, it is
the best kind of food. Here, again, it is the
earth that sends us our food. Fat meat comes
from animals well fed on grain and grass;
sugar, from sugar-cane, maple-trees, or beets;
oil, from olive-trees; butter, from cream; and
starch, from potatoes, and from corn, rice, and
other grains.</p>

<p>Green apples and other unripe fruits are
not yet ready to be eaten. The starch which
we take for food has to be changed into sugar,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
before it can mix with the blood and help
feed the body. As the sun ripens fruit, it
changes its starch to sugar. You can tell
this by the difference in the taste of ripe and
unripe apples.</p>


<h3><br />CANDY.</h3>

<p>Most children like candy so well, that they
are in danger of eating more sugar than is
good for them. You would starve if fed only
on sugar.</p>

<p>We would not need to be quite so much
afraid of a little candy if it were not for the
poison with which it is often colored.</p>

<p>Even what is called pure, white candy is
sometimes not really such. There is a simple
way by which you can find this out for
yourselves.</p>

<p>If you put a spoonful of sugar into a
tumbler of water, it will all dissolve and
disappear. Put a piece of white candy into a
tumbler of water; and, if it is made of pure
sugar only, it will dissolve and disappear.</p>

<p>If it is not, you will find at the bottom
of the tumbler some white earth. This is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
good food for anybody. Candy-makers often
put it into candy in place of sugar, because
it is cheaper than sugar.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>HOW FOOD BECOMES PART OF THE
BODY.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 63px;">
<img src="images/img027h.png" width="63" height="75" alt="H" title="H" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ERE, at last, is the bill of fare for our
dinner:</div>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="A balanced dinner">
<tr><td align='left'>Roast beef,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>Bread,</td><td align='left'>Peaches,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Potatoes,</td><td align='left'>Butter,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>Bananas,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Tomatoes,</td><td align='left'>Salt,</td><td align='left'>Oranges,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Squash,</td><td align='left'>Water,</td><td align='left'>Grapes.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>What must be done first, with the different
kinds of food that are to make up this
dinner?</p>

<p>The meat, vegetables, and bread must be
cooked. Cooking prepares them to be easily
worked upon by the mouth and stomach. If
they were not cooked, this work would be
very hard. Instead of going on quietly and
without letting us know any thing about it,
there would be pains and aches in the overworked
stomach.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The fruit is not cooked by a fire; but we
might almost say the sun had cooked it, for
the sun has ripened and sweetened it.</p>

<p>When you are older, some of you may
have charge of the cooking in your homes.
You must then remember that food well
cooked is worth twice as much as food poorly
cooked.</p>

<p>"A good cook has more to do with the
health of the family, than a good doctor."</p>


<h3><br />THE SALIVA.</h3>

<p>Next to the cooking comes the eating.</p>

<p>As soon as we begin to chew our food, a
juice in the mouth, called saliva (sa l&#299;&acute;v&aacute;),
moistens and mixes with it.</p>

<p>Saliva has the wonderful power of turning
starch into sugar; and the starch in our
food needs to be turned into sugar, before it
can be taken into the blood.</p>

<p>You can prove for yourselves that saliva
can turn starch into sugar. Chew slowly a
piece of dry cracker. The cracker is made
mostly of starch, because wheat is full of
starch. At first, the cracker is dry and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
tasteless. Soon, however, you find it tastes
sweet; the saliva is changing the starch into
sugar.</p>

<p>All your food should be eaten slowly and
chewed well, so that the saliva may be able
to mix with it. Otherwise, the starch may
not be changed; and if one part of your body
neglects its work, another part will have
more than its share to do. That is hardly
fair.</p>

<p>If you swallow your food in a hurry and
do not let the saliva do its work, the stomach
will have extra work. But it will find it
hard to do more than its own part, and,
perhaps, will complain.</p>

<p>It can not speak in words; but will
by aching, and that is almost as plain as
words.</p>


<h3><br />SWALLOWING.</h3>

<p>Next to the chewing, comes the swallowing.
Is there any thing wonderful about
that?</p>

<p>We have two passages leading down our
throats. One is to the lungs, for breathing;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the other, to the stomach, for swallowing.</p>

<p>Do you wonder why the food does not
sometimes go down the wrong way?</p>

<p>The windpipe leading to the lungs is in
front of the other tube. It has at its top a
little trap-door. This opens when we breathe
and shuts when we swallow, so that the food
slips over it safely into the passage behind,
which leads to the stomach.</p>

<p>If you try to speak while you have food
in your mouth, this little door has to open,
and some bit of food may slip in. The
windpipe will not pass it to the lungs,
but tries to force it back. Then we say the
food chokes us. If the windpipe can not
succeed in forcing back the food, the person
will die.</p>


<h3><br />HOW THE FOOD IS CARRIED THROUGH THE BODY.</h3>

<p>But we will suppose that the food of our
dinner has gone safely down into the stomach.
There the stomach works it over, and mixes
in gastric juice, until it is all a gray fluid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it is ready to go into the intestines,&mdash;a
long, coiled tube which leads out of the
stomach,&mdash;from which the prepared food is
taken into the blood.</p>

<p>The blood carries it to the heart. The
heart pumps it out with the blood into the
lungs, and then all through the body, to
make bone, and muscle, and skin, and hair,
and eyes, and brain.</p>

<p>Besides feeding all these parts, this dinner
can help to mend any parts that may be
broken.</p>

<p>Suppose a boy should break one of the
bones of his arm, how could it be mended?</p>

<p>If you should bind together the two parts
of a broken stick and leave them a while, do
you think they would grow together?</p>

<p>No, indeed!</p>

<p>But the doctor could carefully bind together
the ends of the broken bone in the
boy's arm and leave it for awhile, and the
blood would bring it bone food every day,
until it had grown together again.</p>

<p>So a dinner can both make and mend the
different parts of the body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps some of you noticed that we had
no wine, beer, nor any drink that had alcohol
in it, on our bill of fare for dinner. We had
no cigars, either, to be smoked after dinner.
If these are good things, we ought to have
had them. Why did we leave them out?</p>

<div class="center"><i>We should eat in order to grow strong and keep
strong.</i></div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />STRENGTH OF BODY.</h3>

<p>If you wanted to measure your strength,
one way of doing so would be to fasten a
heavy weight to one end of a rope and pass
the rope over a pulley. Then you might take
hold at the other end of the rope and pull as
hard and steadily as you could, marking the
place to which you raised the weight. By
trying this once a week, or once a month,
you could tell by the marks, whether you
were gaining strength.</p>

<p>But how can we gain strength?</p>

<p>We must exercise in the open air, and
take pure air into our lungs to help purify
our blood, and plenty of exercise to make
our muscles grow.</p>

<p>We must eat good and simple food, that
the blood may have supplies to take to every
part of the body.</p>


<h3><br />ALCOHOL AND STRENGTH.</h3>

<p>People used to think that alcohol made
them strong.</p>

<p>Can alcohol make good muscles, or bone,
or nerve, or brain?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>You have already answered "No!" to each
of these questions.</p>

<p>If it can not make muscles, nor bone nor
nerve, nor brain, it can not give you any
strength.</p>


<h3><br />BEER.</h3>

<p>Some people may tell you that drinking
beer will make you strong.</p>

<p>The grain from which the beer is made,
would have given you strength. If you
should measure your strength before and
after drinking beer, you would find that you
had not gained any. Most of the food part of
the grain has been turned into alcohol.</p>


<h3><br />CIDER.</h3>

<p>The juice of crushed apples, you know, is
called cider. As soon as the cider begins to
turn sour, or "hard," as people say, alcohol
begins to form in it.</p>

<p>Pure water is good, and apples are good.
But the apple-juice begins to be a poison as
soon as there is the least drop of alcohol in it.
In cider-making, the alcohol forms in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
juice, you know, in a few hours after it is
pressed out of the apples.</p>

<p>None of the drinks in which there is alcohol,
can give you real strength.</p>

<p>Then why do people think they can?</p>

<p>Because alcohol puts the nerves to sleep,
they can not, truly, tell the brain how hard
the work is, or how heavy the weight to be
lifted.</p>

<p>The alcohol has in this way cheated men
into thinking they can do more than they
really can. This false feeling of strength lasts
only a little while. When it has passed, men
feel weaker than before.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 347px;">
<img src="images/img089.png" width="347" height="500" alt="Ship" title="Ship" />
</div>
<p>A story which shows that alcohol does not
give strength, was told me by the captain of
a ship, who sailed to China and other distant
places.</p>

<p>Many years ago, when people thought a
little alcohol was good, it was the custom to
carry in every ship, a great deal of rum. This
liquor is distilled from molasses and contains
about one half alcohol. This rum was given
to the sailors every day to drink; and, if
there was a great storm, and they had very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
hard work to do, it was the custom to give
them twice as much rum as usual.</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>The captain watched his men and saw
that they were really made no stronger by
drinking the rum; but that, after a little
while, they felt weaker. So he determined to
go to sea with no rum in his ship. Once
out on the ocean, of course the men could
not get any.</p>

<p>At first, they did not like it; but the
captain was very careful to have their food
good and plentiful; and, when a storm came,
and they were wet and cold and tired, he
gave them hot coffee to drink. By the time
they had crossed the ocean, the men said:
"The captain is right. We have worked better,
and we feel stronger, for going without
the rum."</p>


<h3><br />STRENGTH OF MIND.</h3>

<p>We have been talking about the strength
of muscles; but the very best kind of strength
we have is brain strength, or strength of
mind.</p>

<p>Alcohol makes the head ache and deadens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the nerves, so that they can not carry their
messages correctly. Then the brain can not
think well. Alcohol does not strengthen the
mind.</p>

<p>Some people have little or no money, and
no houses or lands; but every person ought
to own a body and a mind that can work for
him, and make him useful and happy.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a strong, healthy body,
hands that are well-trained to work, and a
clear, thinking brain to be master of the whole.
Would you be willing to change places with a
man whose body and mind had been poisoned
by alcohol, tobacco, and opium, even though
he lived in a palace, and had a million of
dollars?</p>

<p>If you want a mind that can study, understand,
and think well, do not let alcohol and
tobacco have a chance to reach it.</p>

<p>It is made of very thick, strong muscles,
as you can see by looking at a beef's heart,
which is much like a man's, but larger.</p>


<h3><br />HOW THE HEART WORKS.</h3>

<p>Probably some of you have seen a fire-engine
throwing a stream of water through
a hose upon a burning building.</p>

<p>As the engine forces the water through
the hose, so the heart, by the working of its
strong muscles, pumps the blood through
tubes, shaped like hose, which lead by thousands
of little branches all through the body.
These tubes are called arteries (&auml;r&acute;t&#277;r iz).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Those tubes which bring the blood back
again to the heart, are called veins (v&#257;nz). You
can see some of the smaller veins in your
wrist.</p>

<p>If you press your finger upon an artery in
your wrist, you can feel the steady beating of
the pulse. This tells just how fast the heart
is pumping and the blood flowing.</p>

<p>The doctor feels your pulse when you are
sick, to find out whether the heart is working
too fast, or too slowly, or just right.</p>

<p>Some way is needed to send the gray fluid
that is made from the food we eat and
drink, to every part of the body.</p>

<p>To send the food with the blood is a sure
way of making it reach every part.</p>

<p>So, when the stomach has prepared the
food, the blood takes it up and carries it to
every part of the body. It then leaves with
each part, just what it needs.</p>


<h3><br />THE BLOOD AND THE BRAIN.</h3>

<p>As the brain has so much work to attend
to, it must have very pure, good blood sent
to it, to keep it strong. Good blood is made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
from good food. It can not be good if it has
been poisoned with alcohol or tobacco.</p>

<p>We must also remember that the brain
needs a great deal of blood. If we take alcohol
into our blood, much of it goes to the
brain. There it affects the nerves, and makes
a man lose control over his actions.</p>


<h3><br />EXERCISE.</h3>

<p>When you run, you can feel your heart
beating. It gets an instant of rest between
the beats.</p>

<p>Good exercise in the fresh air makes the
heart work well and warms the body better
than a fire could do.</p>


<h3><br />DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE HEART?</h3>

<p>Your heart is made of muscle. You know
what harm alcohol does to the muscles.</p>

<p>Could a fatty heart work as well as a muscular
heart? No more than a fatty arm could
do the work of a muscular arm. Besides, alcohol
makes the heart beat too fast, and so it
gets too tired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>THE LUNGS.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 45px;">
<img src="images/img093t.png" width="45" height="75" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HE blood flows all through the body, carrying
good food to every part. It also
gathers up from every part the worn-out
matter that can no longer be used. By the
time it is ready to be sent back by the veins,
the blood is no longer pure and red. It is
dull and bluish in color, because it is full of
impurities.</div>

<p>If you look at the veins in your wrist, you
will see that they look blue.</p>

<p>If all this bad blood goes back to the
heart, will the heart have to pump out bad
blood next time? No, for the heart has neighbors
very near at hand, ready to change the
bad blood to pure, red blood again.</p>


<h3><br />THE LUNGS.</h3>

<p>These neighbors are the lungs. They are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
in the chest on each side of the heart. When
you breathe, their little air-cells swell out, or
expand, to take in the air. Then they contract
again, and the air passes out through
your mouth or nose. The lungs must have
plenty of fresh air, and plenty of room to
work in.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/img098.png" width="300" height="293" alt="The lungs, heart, and air-passages." title="The lungs, heart, and air-passages." />
<span class="caption">The lungs, heart, and air-passages.</span>
</div>

<p>If your clothes are too tight and the lungs
do not have room to expand, they can not
take in so much air as they should. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the blood can not be made pure, and the
whole body will suffer.</p>

<p>For every good breath of fresh air, the
lungs take in, they send out one of impure
air.</p>

<p>In this way, by taking out what is bad,
they prepare the blood to go back to the heart
pure and red, and to be pumped out through
the body again.</p>

<p>How the lungs can use the fresh air for
doing this good work, you can not yet understand.
By and by, when you are older, you
will learn more about it.</p>


<h3><br />CARE OF THE LUNGS.</h3>

<p>Do the lungs ever rest?</p>

<p>You never stop breathing, not even in the
night. But if you watch your own breathing
you will notice a little pause between
the breaths. Each pause is a rest. But the
lungs are very steady workers, both by night
and by day. The least we can do for them,
is to give them fresh air and plenty of room
to work in.</p>

<p>You may say: "We can't give them more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
room than they have. They are shut up in
our chests."</p>

<p>I have seen people who wore such tight
clothes that their lungs did not have room
to take a full breath. If any part of the
lungs can not expand, it will become useless.
If your lungs can not take in air enough to
purify the blood, you can not be so well
and strong as God intended, and your life
will be shortened.</p>

<p>If some one was sewing for you, you would
not think of shutting her up in a little place
where she could not move her hands freely.
The lungs are breathing for you, and need
room enough to do their work.</p>


<h3><br />THE AIR.</h3>

<p>The lungs breathe out the waste matter
that they have taken from the blood. This
waste matter poisons the air. If we should
close all the doors and windows, and the fireplace
or opening into the chimney, and leave
not even a crack by which the fresh air could
come in, we would die simply from staying in
such a room. The lungs could not do their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
work for the blood, and the blood could not
do its work for the body.</p>

<p>Impure air-will poison you. You should
not breathe it. If your head aches, and you
feel dull and sleepy from being in a close
room, a run in the fresh air will make you
feel better.</p>

<p>The good, pure air makes your blood pure;
and the blood then flows quickly through
your whole body and refreshes every part.</p>

<p>We must be careful not to stay in close
rooms in the day-time, nor sleep in close
rooms at night. We must not keep out the
fresh air that our bodies so much need.</p>

<p>It is better to breathe through the nose
than through the mouth. You can soon
learn to do so, if you try to keep your mouth
shut when walking or running.</p>

<p>If you keep the mouth shut and breathe
through the nose, the little hairs on the inside
of the nose will catch the dust or other
impurities that are floating in the air, and so
save their going to the lungs. You will get
out of breath less quickly when running if
you keep your mouth shut.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE LUNGS?</h3>

<p>The little air-cells of the lungs have very
delicate muscular (m&#365;s&acute;ku lar) walls. Every
time we breathe, these walls have to move.
The muscles of the chest must also move, as
you can all notice in yourselves, as you breathe.</p>

<p>All this muscular work, as well as that of
the stomach and heart, is directed by the
nerves.</p>

<p>You have learned already what alcohol
will do to muscles and nerves, so you are
ready to answer for stomach, for heart, and
for lungs. Is alcohol a help to them?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>THE SKIN.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 45px;">
<img src="images/img093t.png" width="45" height="75" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HERE is another part of your body carrying
away waste matter all the time&mdash;it
is the skin.</div>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 183px;">
<img src="images/img104.png" width="183" height="400" alt="Perspiratory tube." title="Perspiratory tube." />
<span class="caption"><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Pe spiratory'">Perspiratory</ins> tube.</span>
</div>
<p>The body is covered with skin. It is also
lined with a more delicate kind of skin. You
can see where the outside skin and the lining
skin meet at your lips.</p>

<p>There is a thin outside layer of skin
which we can pull off without hurting
ourselves; but I advise you not to do so.
Because under the outside skin is the true
skin, which is so full of little nerves that it
will feel the least touch as pain. When the
outer skin, which protects it, is torn away,
we must cover the true skin to keep it from
harm.</p>

<p>In hot weather, or when any one has been
working or playing hard, the face, and sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the whole body, is covered with little
drops of water. We call these drops perspiration
(p&#7869;r sp&#301; r&#257;&acute;sh&#365;n).</p>



<p>Where does it come
from? It comes through
many tiny holes in the
skin, called pores (p&#333;rz).
Every pore is the mouth
of a tiny tube which is carrying
off waste matter and
water from your body. If
you could piece together
all these little perspiration
tubes that are in the skin
of one person, they would
make a line more than
three miles long.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you can not
see the perspiration, because
there is not enough
of it to form drops. But it is always coming
out through your skin, both in winter and
summer. Your body is kept healthy by having
its worn-out matter carried off in this
way, as well as in other ways.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />THE NAILS.</h3>

<p>The nails grow from the skin.</p>

<p>The finger nails are little shields to protect
the ends of your fingers from getting
hurt. These finger ends are full of tiny
nerves, and would be badly off without such
shields. No one likes to see nails that have
been bitten.</p>


<h3><br />CARE OF THE SKIN.</h3>

<p>Waste matter is all the time passing out
through the perspiration tubes in the skin.
This waste matter must not be left to clog up
the little openings of the tubes. It should be
washed off with soap and water.</p>

<p>When children have been playing out-of-doors,
they often have very dirty hands and
faces. Any one can see, then, that they need
to be washed. But even if they had been in
the cleanest place all day and had not
touched any thing dirty, they would still
need the washing; for the waste matter that
comes from the inside of the body is just as
hurtful as the mud or dust of the street. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
do not see it so plainly, because it comes out
very little at a time. Wash it off well, and
your skin will be fresh and healthy, and able
to do its work. If the skin could not do its
work, you would die.</p>

<p>Do not keep on your rubber boots or
shoes all through school-time. Rubber will
not let the perspiration pass off, so the little
pores get clogged and your feet begin to feel
uncomfortable, or your head may ache. No
part can fail to do its work without causing
trouble to the rest of the body. But you
should always wear rubbers out-of-doors
when the ground is wet. Certainly, they
are very useful then.</p>

<p>When you are out in the fresh air, you are
giving the other parts of your body such a
good chance to perspire, that your feet can
bear a little shutting up. But as soon as you
come into the house, take the rubbers off.</p>

<p>Now that you know what the skin is doing
all the time, you will understand that
the clothes worn next to your skin are full
of little worn-out particles, brought out by
the perspiration. When these clothes are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
taken off at night, they should be so spread
out, that they will air well before morning.
Never wear any of the clothes through
the night, that you have worn during the
day.</p>

<p>Do not roll up your night-dress in the
morning and put it under your pillow. Give
it first a good airing at the window and then
hang it where the air can reach it all day.
By so doing, you will have sweeter sleep at
night.</p>

<p>You are old enough to throw the bed-clothes
off from the bed, before leaving your
rooms in the morning. In this way, the bed
and bed-clothes may have a good airing. Be
sure to give them time enough for this.</p>


<h3><br />WORK OF THE BODY.</h3>

<p>You have now learned about four important
kinds of work:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. The stomach prepares the food for the
blood to take.</p>

<p>2d. The blood is pumped out of the heart
to carry food to every part of the body, and
to take away worn-out matter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>3d. The lungs use fresh air in making the
dark, impure blood, bright and pure again.</p>

<p>4th. The skin carries away waste matter
through the little perspiration tubes.</p>

<p>All this work goes on, day and night,
without our needing to think about it at all;
for messages are sent to the muscles by the
nerves which keep them faithfully at work,
whether we know it or not.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>THE SENSES.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/img021w.png" width="83" height="75" alt="W" title="W" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />E have five ways of learning about all
things around us. We can see them,
touch them, taste them, smell them, or hear
them. Sight, touch, taste, smell, and hearing,
are called the five senses.</div>

<p>You already know something about them,
for you are using them all the time.</p>

<p>In this lesson, you will learn a little more
about seeing and hearing.</p>


<h3><br />THE EYES.</h3>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/img110.png" width="300" height="270" alt="The eyelashes and the tear-glands." title="The eyelashes and the tear-glands." />
<span class="caption">The eyelashes and the tear-glands.</span>
</div>
<p>In the middle of your eye is a round,
black spot, called the pupil. This pupil is
only a hole with a muscle around it. When
you are in the light, the muscle draws up,
and makes the pupil small, because you can
get all the light you need through a small
opening. When you are in the dark, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
muscle stretches, and opens the pupil wide to
let in more light.</p>

<p>The pupils of the cat's eyes are very large
in the dark. They
want all the light
they can get, to see
if there are any mice
about.</p>



<p>The pupil of the
eye opens into a
little, round room
where the nerve of
sight is. This is a
safe place for this delicate nerve, which can
not bear too much light. It carries to the
brain an account of every thing we see.</p>

<p>We might say the eye is taking pictures
for us all day long, and that the nerve of
sight is describing these pictures to the brain.</p>


<h3><br />CARE OF THE EYES.</h3>

<p>The nerves of sight need great care, for
they are very delicate.</p>

<p>Do not face a bright light when you are
reading or studying. While writing, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
should sit so that the light will come from
the left side; then the shadow of your hand
will not fall upon your work.</p>

<p>One or two true stories may help you to
remember that you must take good care of
your eyes.</p>

<p>The nerve of sight can not bear too bright
a light. It asks to have the pupil made
small, and even the eyelid curtains put down,
when the light is too strong.</p>

<p>Once, there was a boy who said boastfully
to his playmates: "Let us see which of us
can look straight at the sun for the longest
time."</p>

<p>Then they foolishly began to look at the
sun. The delicate nerves of sight felt a sharp
pain, and begged to have the pupils made as
small as possible and the eyelid curtains put
down.</p>

<p>But the foolish boys said "No." They were
trying to see which would bear it the longest.
Great harm was done to the brains as well
as eyes of both these boys. The one who
looked longest at the sun died in consequence
of his foolish act.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The second story is about a little boy who
tried to turn his eyes to imitate a schoolmate
who was cross-eyed. He turned them;
but he could not turn them back again.
Although he is now a gentleman more than
fifty years old and has had much painful
work done upon his eyes, the doctors have
never been able to set them quite right.</p>

<p>You see from the first story, that you
must be careful not to give your eyes too
much light. But you must also be sure to
give them light enough.</p>

<p>When one tries to read in the twilight,
the little nerve of sight says: "Give me more
light; I am hurt, by trying to see in the
dark."</p>

<p>If you should kill these delicate nerves, no
others would ever grow in place of them, and
you would never be able to see again.</p>


<h3><br />THE EARS.</h3>

<p>What you call your ears are only pieces of
gristle, so curved as to catch the sounds and
pass them along to the true ears. These are
deeper in the head, where the nerve of hearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
is waiting to send an account of each
sound to the brain.</p>


<h3><br />CARE OF THE EARS.</h3>

<p>The ear nerve is in less danger than that
of the eye. Careless children sometimes put
pins into their ears and so break the "drum."
That is a very bad thing to do. Use only a
soft towel in washing your ears. You should
never put any thing hard or sharp into them.</p>

<p>I must tell you a short ear story, about
my father, when he was a small boy.</p>

<p>One day, when playing on the floor, he
laid his ear to the crack of the door, to feel
the wind blow into it. He was so young that
he did not know it was wrong; but the next
day he had the earache severely. Although
he lived to be an old man, he often had
the earache. He thought it began from the
time when the wind blew into his ear from
under that door.</p>


<h3><br />ALCOHOL AND THE SENSES.</h3>

<p>All this fine work of touching, tasting, seeing,
smelling, and hearing, is nerve work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The man who is in the habit of using alcoholic
drinks can not touch, taste, see, smell,
or hear so well as he ought. His hands
tremble, his speech is sometimes thick, and
often he can not walk straight. Sometimes,
he thinks he sees things when he does not,
because his poor nerves are so confused by
alcohol that they can not do their work.</p>

<p>Answer now for your taste, smell, and
touch, and also for your sight and hearing;
should their beautiful work be spoiled by
alcohol?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>HEAT AND COLD.</h3>


<h3><br />WHAT MAKES US WARM?</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 68px;">
<img src="images/img115m.png" width="68" height="75" alt="M" title="M" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />Y thick, warm clothes make me warm,"
says some child.</div>

<p>No! Your thick, warm clothes keep you
warm. They do not make you warm.</p>

<p>Take a brisk run, and your blood will flow
faster and you will be warm very quickly.</p>

<p>On a cold day, the teamster claps his
hands and swings his arms to make his blood
flow quickly and warm him.</p>

<p>Every child knows that he is warm inside;
for if his fingers are cold, he puts them into
his mouth to warm them.</p>

<p>If you should put a little thermometer
into your mouth, or under your tongue, the
mercury (m&#7869;r&acute;ku&nbsp;r<ins title="Transcriber's Note: This symbol not supported in all browsers: y with a breve">y&#774;</ins>)
 would rise as high as it
does out of doors on a hot, summer day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>This would be the same in summer or
winter, in a warm country or a cold one, if
you were well and the work of your body was
going on steadily.</p>


<h3><br />WHERE DOES THIS HEAT COME FROM?</h3>

<p>Some of the work which is all the time
going on inside your body, makes this heat.</p>

<p>The blood is thus warmed, and then it
carries the heat to every part of the body.
The faster the blood flows, the more heat it
brings, and the warmer we feel.</p>

<p>In children, the heart pumps from eighty
to ninety times a minute.</p>

<p>This is faster than it works in old people,
and this is one reason why children are generally
much warmer than old people.</p>

<p>But we are losing heat all the time.</p>

<p>You may breathe in cold air; but that
which you breathe out is warm. A great deal
of heat from your warm body is all the time
passing off through your skin, into the cooler
air about you. For this reason, a room full
of people is much warmer than the same
room when empty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />CLOTHING.</h3>

<p>We put on clothes to keep in the heat
which we already have, and to prevent the
cold air from reaching our skins and carrying
off too much heat in that way.</p>

<p>Most of you children are too young to
choose what clothes you will wear. Others
decide for you. You know, however, that
woolen under-garments keep you warm in
winter, and that thick boots and stockings
should be worn in cold weather. Thin dresses
or boots may look pretty; but they are not
safe for winter wear, even at a party.</p>

<p>A healthy, happy child, dressed in clothes
which are suitable for the season, is pleasanter
to look at than one whose dress, though
rich and handsome, is not warm enough for
health or comfort.</p>

<p>When you feel cold, take exercise, if possible.
This will make the hot blood flow all
through your body and warm it. If you can
not, you should put on more clothes, go to
a warm room, in some way get warm and
keep warm, or the cold will make you sick.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />TAKING COLD.</h3>

<p>If your skin is chilled, the tiny mouths
of the perspiration tubes are sometimes closed
and can not throw out the waste matter.
Then, if one part fails to do its work, other
parts must suffer. Perhaps the inside skin
becomes inflamed, or the throat and lungs,
and you have a cold, or a cough.</p>


<h3><br />ALCOHOL AND COLD.</h3>

<p>People used to think that nothing would
warm one so well on a cold day, as a glass
of whiskey, or other alcoholic drink.</p>

<p>It is true that, if a person drinks a little
alcohol, he will feel a burning in the throat,
and presently a glowing heat on the skin.</p>

<p>The alcohol has made the hot blood rush
into the tiny tubes near the skin, and he
thinks it has warmed him.</p>

<p>But if all this heat comes to the skin, the
cold air has a chance to carry away more
than usual. In a very little time, the
drinker will be colder than before. Perhaps
he will not know it; for the cheating alcohol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
will have deadened his nerves so that they
send no message to the brain. Then he may
not have sense enough to put on more clothing
and may freeze. He may even, if it is
very cold, freeze to death.</p>

<p>People, who have not been drinking alcohol
are sometimes frozen; but they would
have frozen much quicker if they had drunk it.</p>

<p>Horse-car drivers and omnibus drivers
have a hard time on a cold winter day. They
are often cheated into thinking that alcohol
will keep them warm; but doctors have
learned that it is the water-drinkers who
hold out best against the cold. Alcohol can
not really keep a person warm.</p>

<p>All children are interested in stories about
Arctic explorers, whose ships get frozen into
great ice-fields, who travel on sledges drawn
by dogs, and sometimes live in Esquimau
huts, and drink oil, and eat walrus meat.</p>

<p>These men tell us that alcohol will not
keep them warm, and you know why.</p>

<p>The hunters and trappers in the snowy
regions of the Rocky Mountains say the same
thing. Alcohol not only can not keep them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
warm; but it lessens their power to resist
cold.</p>

<span class="caption">Scene in the Arctic regions.</span>
</div>

<p>Many of you have heard about the Greely
party who were brought home from the Arctic
seas, after they had been starving and freezing
for many months.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>There were twenty-six men in all. Of
these, nineteen died. Seven were found alive
by their rescuers; one of these died soon
afterward. The first man who died, was the
only one of the party who had ever been a
drunkard.</p>

<p>Of the nineteen who died, all but one used
tobacco. Of the six now living,&mdash;four never
used tobacco at all; and the other two, very
seldom.</p>

<p>The tobacco was no real help to them in
time of trouble. It had probably weakened
their stomachs, so that they could not make
the best use of such poor food as they had.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>WASTED MONEY.</h3>


<h3><br />COST OF ALCOHOL.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 59px;">
<img src="images/img071n.png" width="59" height="75" alt="N" title="N" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />OW that you have learned about your
bodies, and what alcohol will do to
them, you ought also to know that alcohol
costs a great deal of money. Money spent for
that which will do no good, but only harm,
is certainly wasted, and worse than wasted.</div>

<p>If a boy or a girl save ten cents a week,
it will take ten weeks to save a dollar.</p>

<p>You can all think of many good and pleasant
ways to spend a dollar. What would the
beer-drinker do with it? If he takes two
mugs of beer a day, the dollar will be used
up in ten days. But we ought not to say
used, because that word will make us think
it was spent usefully. We will say, instead,
the dollar will be wasted, in ten days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>If he spends it for wine or whiskey, it will
go sooner, as these cost more. If no money
was spent for liquor in this country, people
would not so often be sick, or poor, or bad,
or wretched. We should not need so many
policemen, and jails, and prisons, as we have
now. If no liquor was drunk, men, women,
and children would be better and happier.</p>


<h3><br />COST OF TOBACCO.</h3>

<p>Most of you have a little money of your
own. Perhaps you earned a part, or the
whole of it, yourselves. You are planning
what to do with it, and that is a very pleasant
kind of planning.</p>

<p>Do you think it would be wise to make
a dollar bill into a tight little roll, light one
end of it with a match, and then let it
slowly burn up? That would be wasting it,
you say! (<a href="#front"><i>See Frontispiece.</i></a>)</p>

<p>Yes! it would be wasted, if thus burned.
It would be worse than wasted, if, while burning,
it should also hurt the person who held
it. If you should buy cigars or tobacco with
your dollar, and smoke them, you could soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
burn up the dollar and hurt yourselves
besides.</p>

<p>Can you count a million? Can you count
a hundred millions? Try some day to do this
counting. Then, when you begin to have
some idea how much six hundred millions is,
remember that six hundred million dollars
are spent in this country every year for tobacco&mdash;burned
up&mdash;wasted&mdash;worse than wasted.</p>

<p>Do you think the farmer who planted tobacco
instead of corn, did any good to the
world by the change?</p>
